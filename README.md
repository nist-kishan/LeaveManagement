# Leave Management System (MERN Stack MVP)

A modern, full-stack Leave Management System built for startups to streamline employee and leave management. This MVP allows HR teams to add employees, process leave applications, and track leave balances efficiently through a clean and responsive React frontend powered by a robust Node.js + Express backend API with MongoDB database.

---

## Features

- Add, view, and delete employees with key details (name, email, department, joining date).
- Employees can apply for leave within their allowed balance.
- HR can approve or reject leave requests with real-time leave balance updates.
- Prevent overlapping leave requests and enforce leave policies.
- View leave balances per employee on demand.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface styled with modern CSS.
- Backend API with thorough validations and error handling.

## API Endpoints

### Employee APIs
| Method | Endpoint                       | Description                 |
|--------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/employees`               | Add a new employee          |
| GET    | `/api/employees`               | List all employees          |
| GET    | `/api/employees/:id`           | Get employee details        |
| GET    | `/api/employees/:id/balance`  | Get leave balance           |
| DELETE | `/api/employees/:id`           | Delete employee             |

### Leave APIs
| Method | Endpoint                        | Description                 |
|--------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/leaves`                  | Apply for leave             |
| GET    | `/api/leaves`                  | List leave requests         |
| PATCH  | `/api/leaves/:id/status`       | Approve or reject leave     |

---

## Important Functionalities and Validations

- Prevent leave applications before employeeâ€™s joining date.
- Validate that end date is not before start date.
- Check sufficient leave balance before applying or approving leave.
- Prevent overlapping active (pending/approved) leave requests for the same employee.
- Email uniqueness enforced on employee creation.
- Leave balance deduction is atomic during approval.
- Proper HTTP status codes and error messages returned on failure.

---

## Deployment

### Frontend

- Hosted on **Vercel**.
- Uses environment variable `VITE_API_BASE` to point to backend API URL.

### Backend

- Hosted on **Render**, **Heroku**, **Railway**, or similar platform.
- Connected to **MongoDB Atlas** or your MongoDB instance.
- CORS configured to allow frontend domain.

---

## How to Use

1. Add an employee with basic details.
2. View the list of all employees.
3. Apply for leave (once ApplyLeave form is integrated).
4. HR reviews leave requests and updates status.
5. Track leave balances anytime from employee list.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add Apply Leave frontend form for employees.
- Role-based authentication and authorization.
- Leave cancellation and modification flows.
- Email and notification system.
- Leave accrual and carry-forward policies.
- Pagination and enhanced UI/UX improvements.
- Robust concurrency handling with DB transactions.
